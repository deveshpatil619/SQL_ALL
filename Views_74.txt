## creating view table with only id and name columns

create view empone_view
as 
select  id,name from emp

## creating the view table with where condition in it

create view emponeview1

select * from emp where experiance>10


select * from emponeview1


## creating another table {This is real table and not a view}

create table empss (id int,country varchar(20))

insert into empss values (1,"usa")
insert into empss values (2,"uk")
insert into empss values (3,"india")

select * from empss

## now we will create a view taking columns from emp and empss table
## complex_view example

create view emponeview2
as 
select e.id,name,country from emp e,empss em where e.id = em.id


select * from emponeview2


## creating another view table 

create view emp_view
as
select * from emp

## now we will insert into original table which is the emp

select * from emp
insert into emp values(5,'dev',4)


# the changes will be reflected into the view table as well 
select * from emp_view
